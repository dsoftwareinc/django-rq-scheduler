2. Click on the **Add** link for Scheduled Job.

3. Enter a unique name for the job in the **Name** field.

4. In the **Callable** field, enter a Python dot notation path to the method that defines the job. For the example above, that would be `myapp.jobs.count`

5. Choose your **Queue**. Side Note: The queues listed are defined in the Django Settings.

6. Enter the time the job is to be executed in the **Scheduled time** field. Side Note: Enter the date via the browser's local timezone, the time will automatically convert UTC.

7. Click the **Save** button to schedule the job.
